Repository for the R script used for the manuscript "Developing Stable, Simplified, Functional Consortia from Brachypodium Rhizosphere for Microbial Application in Sustainable Agriculture". I use "RCC_R_Script" to generate figures and perform analysis for the 768 original enrichment samples, and "RCC_R_stability test" for the 25 samples derived from RCC for stability tests.
